i dont know how long we were going, and to this hour i know as little where we went. perhaps it was near guildford. perhaps some arabiannight magician, opened up the place for the day, and shut it up for ever when we came away. it was a green spot, on a hill, carpeted with soft turf. there were shady trees, and heather, and, as far as the eye could see, a rich landscape.
